Hello Everyone!!!
In today's digital age, having a website is a normal, but integrating it with Google Sheets for data storage seems like a game-changer to me.
Therefore I've just developed a website that automatically stores all user email addresses directly into a Google Sheet. 
This integration will not only help in data management it will also enhance accessibility and collaboration.
Now no need for manual entries!!
